## Pizza Project End to End project (Excel, SQL, Tableau)

##### By: Steven Nguyen

## Introduction

##### In this project I will use MySQL to explore and analyze data and provide insights for a pizzeria. The dataset provided is a free dataset that is made publicly available on Maven Analytics.

## Objective
As a data analyst hired by a pizza company, my objective is to make data-driven decisions to enhance their overall business performance and identify trends. To achieve this, I will address the following questions and more:

1. What days and times experience the highest customer traffic?
2. How many pizzas are typically sold during peak periods?
3. Which pizzas are the best and worst sellers?
4. What is the average order value?
